DCMI is a little attempt to make a meshy IRC server-to-server protocol.

Very early days, many notebook pages filled with mockups and diagrams, and not much actually written up properly as computer-based documents yet.

This protocol is roughly based on [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).

If you're not an IRC server developer, it's probably best to **ignore this repo**. If you are an IRC server dev, feel free to take a look but this is pre-planning stages and will be rewritten, reworked, and rearchitected many times over.
